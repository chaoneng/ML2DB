How to prepare and apply machine learning to your dataset #August 25, 2017 #By Euthymios Kasvikis
If you are a newbie in the world of machine learning, then this tutorial is exactly what you need in order to introduce yourself to this exciting new part of the data science world.

This post includes a full machine learning project that will guide you step by step to create a “template,” which you can use later on other datasets.

In this step-by-step tutorial you will:

1. Use one of the most popular machine learning packages in R.
2. Explore a dataset by using statistical summaries and data visualization.
3. Build 5 machine-learning models, pick the best, and build confidence that the accuracy is reliable.

The process of a machine learning project may not be exactly the same, but there are certain standard and necessary steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.
